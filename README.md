- 👋 Hi, I’m @AnemoiaMateria
- 👀 I’m interested in a lot of nerdy things, but honestly anything people are passionate about!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python through boot.dev, preparing for an internship in Mainframe Development!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on smaller applications and programs, usually related to everday activities like gaming/hobbies.
- 📫 How to reach me? Email is the likeliest option, or if Github has any form of messaging!
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I graduated with a degree in medicine, so this is a huge shift for me!
